# Deployment and configuration

Two apps: the Go API (`apps/backend-go`, Railway) and the Next.js frontend (`apps/frontend`, Cloudflare Workers via
OpenNext). Browsers only talk to the frontend; its server forwards API calls (BFF) and keeps the session in httpOnly
cookies.

```
browser ──► frontend (Cloudflare)  ──BACKEND_URL──►  Go API (Railway) ──► Postgres, Redis
               │  X-Client-IP + X-BFF-Secret             │
               └── Google sign-in redirects the browser to BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL/api/auth/google/start
```

## Go API environment (`apps/backend-go`)

| Variable | Required | Production value / notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_ENV` | prod | `production` — the server refuses to start if anything below marked "prod" is missing or unsafe; also JSON logs, HSTS, gin release mode |
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | Postgres connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | yes | ≥ 32 random characters (`openssl rand -base64 48`). Rotating it signs everyone out |
| `PORT` | no | Set by Railway |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | prod | Frontend origin, `https://…` — used in email links and after Google sign-in |
| `API_BASE_URL` | prod | This API's public origin, `https://…` — Google OAuth callback |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | prod | Frontend origin(s), comma-separated, no path. Production: `https://sakdulur.com,tauri://localhost,http://tauri.localhost` (the last two are the desktop and mobile apps, which call the API directly) |
| `BFF_SHARED_SECRET` | prod | ≥ 32 random characters, **same value as the frontend's** |
| `TRUSTED_PROXIES` / `CLIENT_IP_HEADER` | prod (one) | For requests that do not come through the frontend. If unsure on Railway use `TRUSTED_PROXIES=none` |
| `REDIS_URL` | prod | Rate limits and caching are off without it |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | prod | Transactional email (verification, reset, invites) |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | recommended | e.g. `Sakdulur <noreply@sakdulur.com>` on a domain verified in Resend |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | for photos | `cloudinary://key:secret@cloud`; without it production rejects photo uploads |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | optional | Enables "Continue with Google". Authorized redirect URI: `${API_BASE_URL}/api/auth/google/callback` |
| `MOBILE_APP_SCHEME` | desktop/mobile apps | `com.fahmialfareza.sakdulur` — Google sign-in started in the app returns through this URL scheme |
| `APPLE_CLIENT_IDS` | Sign in with Apple | Accepted token audiences: the app id `com.fahmialfareza.sakdulur` (iPhone/Mac sheet) and the Services ID below |
| `APPLE_SERVICES_ID` | Sign in with Apple | Services ID for the web flow (website, Windows/Linux/Android apps), e.g. `com.fahmialfareza.sakdulur.web`; return URL `https://api.sakdulur.com/api/auth/apple/callback` |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_KEY_ID`, `APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY` | Sign in with Apple | "Sign in with Apple" key (.p8, newlines as `\n`); used to revoke Apple tokens on account deletion |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY` | optional | AI assistant; tried in this order, each on when its key is set. Use a **paid** Gemini key for real family data (the free tier may use prompts to improve Google's products) |
| `AI_GEMINI_MODELS`, `AI_GROQ_MODELS` | optional | Comma-separated models per provider, tried in order (defaults in `.env.example`) |
| `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` | optional | Langfuse v4 tracing of assistant calls (models, tokens, latency, fallbacks, tool names; no message text). Off when empty. `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` defaults to `https://cloud.langfuse.com`; `LANGFUSE_TRACING_ENVIRONMENT` defaults to `APP_ENV` |
| `AI_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`, `AI_DAILY_LIMIT` | optional | Timeout per model call (default `25s`; a question may make several, within 55s overall) and questions per user per day (default `100`) |
| `NEW_RELIC_ENABLED`, `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME`, `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` | optional | APM / error tracking |
| `DB_MAX_OPEN_CONNS`, `DB_MAX_IDLE_CONNS` | optional | Pool size (defaults 20 / 10) |
| `TREE_DEBUG` | no | `1` for debug logs on tree endpoints |
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | dev only | Local photo storage when Cloudinary is not set (served at `/uploads`) |

## Frontend environment (`apps/frontend`)

`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined at **build** time, so set them where `pnpm deploy` runs (CI or your machine).
The others are read at runtime: set them in the Worker (`wrangler secret put` for secrets).

| Variable | Where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BACKEND_URL` | runtime (required) | Go API URL reachable from the Worker, e.g. `https://api.familytree.example` |
| `BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL` | runtime | Go API URL for browsers (Google sign-in); defaults to `BACKEND_URL` |
| `BFF_SHARED_SECRET` | runtime secret | Same value as the API's |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | build (required) | This site's origin: `https://sakdulur.com`. Used for canonical URLs, hreflang, sitemap, structured data and `llms.txt` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL` | build | Footer and legal pages (default `fahmialfareza97@gmail.com`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPERATOR_NAME` | build | Named in the Privacy Policy and Terms (default `Fahmi Alfareza`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_HOSTS` | build | Extra image origins for the CSP (Cloudinary is built in) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BING_SITE_VERIFICATION` | build (optional) | Verification codes from Google Search Console / Bing Webmaster Tools (the `content` of their meta tag) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | build (optional) | Sentry DSN for browser reports (errors, traces, replays on error, logs). Sent through `/api/monitoring`, so the CSP needs no change. Unset = off |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | runtime (optional) | Same DSN for the Worker's server-side reports (`worker.ts`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | build (optional) | Sentry environment (default `production`) |
| `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | build (optional) | Upload source maps during the build; the release is the commit (`WORKERS_CI_COMMIT_SHA`) |
| `IOS_APP_IDS` | runtime (mobile) | `<TeamID>.com.fahmialfareza.sakdulur`; serves `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` |
| `ANDROID_APP_PACKAGE`, `ANDROID_CERT_SHA256` | runtime (mobile) | Package name and signing fingerprints; serves `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` |

**Language:** the account's language (applied at sign-in), then the `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie, then the visitor's
country (`cf-ipcountry`, added by Cloudflare's IP Geolocation setting, on by default: Indonesia → Indonesian,
elsewhere → English), then the browser's Accept-Language. Changing the language while signed in saves it on the
account (migration 00008).

Local development needs none of these: both apps fall back to `http://localhost:3000` / `http://localhost:4000`.

## Going live checklist

1. **Back up production** (`gh workflow run "Weekly Postgres Backup"`) and confirm the dump in R2.
2. Set every "prod" variable above on Railway, plus `APP_ENV=production`, and the frontend variables in Cloudflare.
   Generate secrets with `openssl rand -base64 48`.
3. Resend: verify the sending domain; set `EMAIL_FROM` on it.
4. Google (optional): create an OAuth client (Web), add the redirect URI above, set the two variables.
5. Merge to `main` (Railway deploys the API; migrations 00002–00004 run on startup under an advisory lock),
   then deploy the frontend (`pnpm --filter frontend deploy`).
6. Smoke test: `/healthz`, `/readyz`, sign in with a family account, open the tree, sign up a new account
   (check the email arrives), invite someone.
7. Tell the family: everyone is signed out once (old tokens are rejected) and should add an email to their
   account (Account → Email) so they can reset passwords and accept invites.

## SEO and AI search

- Public pages have a URL per language: `/en`, `/id`, `/en/privacy`, `/id/terms`, ... (hreflang + self canonical;
  `x-default` is the English URL). The plain `/`, `/privacy` and `/terms` pick the language per visitor and point
  their canonical to that language's URL. Old `?lang=en|id` URLs redirect (301) to these. Everything under
  `/app`, `/auth`, `/invite` and `/api` is disallowed in `robots.txt`.
- Landing page carries JSON-LD (Organization, WebSite, WebApplication, FAQPage). `/llms.txt` summarizes Sakdulur for
  AI assistants. `robots.txt` explicitly allows AI crawlers (GPTBot, OAI-SearchBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot,
  Google-Extended, ...) on public pages.
- **Cloudflare:** check Security → Bots / AI Crawl Control and keep "Block AI bots" and the managed robots.txt
  **off**, otherwise Cloudflare blocks the AI crawlers the site invites (it is on by default for some new domains).
- After launch: add `sakdulur.com` to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools (set the verification env vars
  above), submit `https://sakdulur.com/sitemap.xml` (resubmit after URL changes), and test the landing page in Google's Rich Results Test.
- **Guides** (`/en/guides`, `/id/guides/<slug>`): content in `apps/frontend/src/lib/guides-content.ts`, slugs in
  `src/lib/guides.ts`. To add one, add its slug and both languages' content; the sitemap, middleware, `llms.txt`,
  the landing page and the guides index pick it up. Each guide has Article, BreadcrumbList and FAQPage JSON-LD.
- **IndexNow:** the key file `apps/frontend/public/<key>.txt` proves ownership; `.github/workflows/indexnow.yml`
  sends every sitemap URL to IndexNow (Bing, Copilot, Yandex, ...) 10 minutes after a push to `main` that touches
  public pages. After a deploy it missed: `gh workflow run IndexNow` (or `node apps/frontend/scripts/indexnow.mjs`).

## Admin dashboard

`https://sakdulur.com/admin` shows platform totals, sign-ups and people added per day, active users, the newest
accounts, the largest trees and system status (database, Redis, email, sign-in providers, AI providers). It is
only for accounts with `users.role = 'admin'`; everyone else gets a 404. To make someone an admin:
`UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'you@example.com';` (they need to reload).

## Mobile apps

The desktop and mobile apps (`apps/native`, Tauri 2: macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android) show the production
site in a native window. They open on `/app` (signed-out users get the app-only `/welcome` screen instead of the
landing page), do Google sign-in in the system browser with a deep link back, and save downloads natively. Setup
and release steps are in [`apps/native/README.md`](../apps/native/README.md). Migration 00006 adds the Apple
columns to `users`.

## Operations

- **Health**: `GET /healthz` (process up) and `GET /readyz` (Postgres + Redis). The Docker image has a HEALTHCHECK.
- **Migrations**: SQL files in `apps/backend-go/internal/migrations`, applied on startup. Roll back one step with
  `go run github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@v3.29.0 -dir internal/migrations postgres "$DATABASE_URL" down`.
- **Backups**: weekly dumps kept 8 weeks (`docs/postgres-backup.md`). Practice a restore
  into a scratch database with `scripts/restore-postgres.sh` every few months.
- **Monitoring**: with New Relic enabled, alert on error rate, p95 latency and 5xx; add an uptime check on `/readyz`.
- **Staging**: run a second Railway environment and Worker with their own database, secrets and URLs before
  shipping risky changes.
- **Dependencies**: Dependabot opens weekly PRs (Go, npm) and monthly ones (Actions, Docker); CI runs lint, types,
  build, Go tests against Postgres + Redis, staticcheck and govulncheck.
