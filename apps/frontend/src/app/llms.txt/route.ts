## Key facts

- Price: free to use; no ads; family data is never sold.
- Privacy: every tree is private and visible only to invited members. Owners choose editors and viewers and can share individual branches. Trees can be exported (Excel, GEDCOM for other genealogy apps, or a full JSON backup) or deleted at any time.
- Family tree: couples side by side, children under their own parents, ancestors and descendants together, remarriages and divorces, birth, adoptive, step, foster, guardian and milk parents (Indonesian: kandung, angkat, tiri, asuh, wali, susuan), siblings grouped as full, half, step or foster, approximate dates ("about 1920"), birth and death places, notes and photos. Optional religion per person decides how deceased relatives are marked (Alm./Almh., a cross, or a neutral mark). Print the tree, or save the whole tree or one branch as an image.
- Collaboration: invite relatives by email or with a shareable link that expires; branch owners maintain their own part of the tree; copy a branch between your trees (for example your own, your spouse's and your in-laws').
- AI assistant (optional, turned on per tree by its owner): answers questions such as "Who is Ayu's father and where does he live?" from the tree, and lets editors add or update people, relationships and families by chatting ("Add Rani as Ayu's daughter, born 1994"). Every change is shown first and saved only when the user presses Apply; the assistant never deletes. Uses Google Gemini or Groq; phone numbers and photos are never sent, and conversations are not stored.
- Sign in with email and password, Google or Apple. Works in any modern browser, and as an app (below); the same account and trees everywhere; light and dark mode.
- Made in Indonesia; operated under Indonesia's Personal Data Protection Law (UU PDP). Minimum age 13.
